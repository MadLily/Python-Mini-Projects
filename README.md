# Python Mini Projects  

This is a folder for **mini-projects** I did with Python. Each "Mini-project" features a choice of topic (or dataset) and also libraries that I am playing with. By doing this I was hoping to pick up new skills and also to have a glimpse of how data from various domains can be explored and modeled. You can later find a full list of content here in this markdown.  

Also please feel free to give any suggestions!
